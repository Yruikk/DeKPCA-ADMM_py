# DKPCA-ADMM
A Decentralized algorithm for Kernel Principal Component Analysis (DeKPCA) for sample-distributed setting, where each local agent contains a subset of samples with full features.

This is Python code of our paper, which uses mpi4py to accomplish truly parallel setting.

Eigenvectors computed by SVD is regarded as ground truth.
